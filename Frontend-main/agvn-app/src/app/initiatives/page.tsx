    The central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the traditions and values of the culture and civilization in which it appears. In Western culture, conservatives seek to conserve a range of things such as organized religion, property rights, parliamentary government, family values, the natural environment, and classical and vernacular architecture.`,

            Your vote helps determine the overall political direction of government policies and decisions.
            Each initiative represents a different approach to governance, economics, and social issues.
            The initiative with the most votes will influence the types of policies that are prioritized
            and implemented.
